# Weather App

A minimalist **Node.js** web application that provides **real-time weather updates**. By default, it displays weather information for **Istanbul**, but users can also retrieve their **current location weather** and other searched cities weather.

## Features

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API calls.
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides the weather data.
- **Environment Variables**: API keys are securely managed with a `.env` file, ensuring they are not hardcoded.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment is available for easy setup and scaling. üê≥
